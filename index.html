                                <p>Olivia Magyar's journey in the performing arts began early and has showcased her diverse talents in both acting and singing. Her musical talent was first noticed when, at just 3 years old, she performed at the Tokaj Harvest Festival, singing a Hungarian folk song to great acclaim. This early exposure set the stage for her future endeavors in the arts.</p>
                                <p>By 2016, Olivia had already made a name for herself in the competitive world of television talent shows. She appeared on RTL's 'Little Giants', a show where children showcase various talents. Her exceptional vocal performances led her to win her category, confirming her potential as a singer.</p>
                                <p>In 2017, Olivia transitioned into acting, appearing in an image film for Richter Gedeon Pharmaceuticals. Her acting skills caught the attention of wider audiences and industry professionals alike. That same year, she was also actively involved in the 'Kővirágok' singing school, performing songs from popular Disney movies such as "Pocahontas" and "The Princess and the Frog" at the school’s flagship anniversary events.</p>
                                <p>2019 was a particularly eventful year for Olivia. She was cast in the lead role of Hanna in the daily fiction telenovela 'Señores Papis/Dear Daddies' on Hungary's leading commercial channel, TV2. The show, a Hungarian adaptation of the Argentinean original, was a significant commitment that spanned three seasons and 199 episodes through 2021. Her portrayal received positive reviews from both critics and audiences. Additionally, in 2019, Olivia competed in the national singing competition 'Soundwave', where she was the youngest finalist, showcasing her continuing development as a vocalist.</p>
                                <p>The year 2021 saw Olivia expanding her repertoire further. She starred as Elza in the film 'Real Siblings', directed by Kristóf Kiss-Szeif, and served as a child judge on TV2’s gastro-reality show 'Game of Chefs GR - child jury'. Her musical career continued to flourish as well; she performed the song 'Memory' from the musical 'Cats' at its 1500th anniversary performance at the Madách Theatre in Budapest.</p>
                                <p>In addition to her acting and singing, Olivia is a member of the SoulAir chamber choir. Her involvement has led to numerous opportunities, including performing at various significant events, such as the UEFA 2020 Budapest opening ceremony and a special video clip for Elton John's 75th birthday.</p>
